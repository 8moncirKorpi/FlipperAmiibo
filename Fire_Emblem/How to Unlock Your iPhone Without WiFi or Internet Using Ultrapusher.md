The answer is yes, thanks to a utility called Ultrapusher. Ultrapusher is a Windows program that lets you inject MobileSubstrate and Ultrasn0w files into your iPhone via USB. This way, you can unlock your iPhone without needing Wi-Fi or internet.
 
Here are the steps to use Ultrapusher to unlock your iPhone offline:
 
1. Download Ultrapusher from [this link](https://www.megaleecher.net/taxonomy/term/9474) [^2^].
2. Extract the zip file and run UltraPusher.exe.
3. Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB and make sure iTunes recognizes it.
4. Click on "Push MobileSubstrate" and wait for the process to complete.
5. Click on "Push Ultrasn0w" and wait for the process to complete.
6. Reboot your iPhone and insert your desired SIM card.
7. Enjoy your unlocked iPhone!

Note: Ultrapusher only works with iPhone 3G and 3GS with baseband 04.26.08, 05.11.07, 05.12.01, 05.13.04, or 06.15.00. You also need to have jailbroken your iPhone with Redsn0w, Blackra1n, or PwnageTool before using Ultrapusher.
 
Ultrapusher is a handy tool for unlocking your iPhone without Wi-Fi or internet. However, if you have access to Wi-Fi or internet, you can use other online video downloaders like [YT1s.com](https://yt1s.com/) [^1^], [ACETHINKER](https://www.acethinker.com/online-downloader-1) [^3^], or [URLUSO](https://urluso.com/2t9Kgt) [^4^] to download YouTube videos or other online videos to your device.
  
Why would you want to unlock your iPhone? There are many benefits of unlocking your iPhone, such as:

- You can use any SIM card from any carrier in any country.
- You can save money on roaming charges when traveling abroad.
- You can access more features and apps that are not available in your region.
- You can customize your iPhone with themes and tweaks that are not allowed by Apple.

However, unlocking your iPhone also has some risks and drawbacks, such as:

- You may void your warranty and lose Apple's support.
- You may damage your iPhone or brick it if you use the wrong software or method.
- You may experience bugs, glitches, or reduced performance on your iPhone.
- You may not be able to update your iPhone to the latest iOS version or use some features like FaceTime or iMessage.

Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons of unlocking your iPhone before you decide to do it. You should also backup your iPhone data and follow the instructions carefully to avoid any problems.
  
How does Ultrapusher work? Ultrapusher is a simple program that copies the necessary files for unlocking your iPhone to your device via USB. It does not require any installation or configuration on your computer or iPhone. It works by exploiting a vulnerability in the USB communication protocol that allows it to access the iPhone file system.
 
What are MobileSubstrate and Ultrasn0w? MobileSubstrate and Ultrasn0w are two essential components for unlocking your iPhone. MobileSubstrate is a framework that allows developers to modify the behavior of iOS without changing the original code. Ultrasn0w is a software that patches the baseband of your iPhone to accept any SIM card.
 
Are there any alternatives to Ultrapusher? Yes, there are other ways to unlock your iPhone without Wi-Fi or internet, such as:

- Using Redsn0w to jailbreak and unlock your iPhone in one step.
- Using Sn0wbreeze to create a custom firmware that includes Ultrasn0w and restore it to your iPhone.
- Using iFunbox or iExplorer to manually copy MobileSubstrate and Ultrasn0w files to your iPhone.

However, these methods may be more complicated or risky than using Ultrapusher. You should always do some research and follow the instructions carefully before attempting any of these methods.
